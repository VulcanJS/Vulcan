- **All PRs should be made to the `devel` branch, not `master`.**

- Come check-in in the [Telescope Slack channel](http://slack.telescopeapp.org/). ðŸ‘‹

- Completely new features should be shipped as external packages with their own repos (see [3rd party packages](http://nova-docs.telescopeapp.org/plugins.html)). Don't hesitate to come by the [Slack channel](http://slack.telescopeapp.org/) to speak about it.

- We don't have test at the moment, and Travis integration is broken. If you know how to fix it, you are welcome (see [#1253](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues/1253)!

- Be nice ðŸ˜‰
