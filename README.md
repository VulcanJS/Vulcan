# Vulcan

[Version 1.8.1](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan/releases)

Vulcan is a React+GraphQL framework for Meteor. 

### Install

- [Full video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCjR9UrNqVk)

Install the latest version of Node and NPM. We recommend the usage of [NVM](http://nvm.sh).

You can then install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install), which is used as the Vulcan build tool.

Clone the [Vulcan Starter repo](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan-Starter) locally.

Rename your `sample_settings.json` file to `settings.json`, then:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

And open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.


Find more info in the [documentation](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/#Install).
