UXpile is a fork of [Telescope](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope), a real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com). Like Telescope, it's open-source and MIT licensed.

Wherever possible, development will be confined to the `packages/uxpile` package. Pull requests against this package are encouraged. For any other contribution, please use the main Telescope repo.
