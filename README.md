Telescope is an open-source, real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com)

**Note:** Telescope is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)

# Hosting Telescope

I recommend using either Meteor's own free hosting service, or checking out [Modulus](http://modulus.io/). 

# First Run
- Fill in your Twitter keys (by clicking on "Sign Up/Sign in" in your Telescope top bar)
- The first user account created will automatically be made admin
- Check out the settings page and fill out basic things like the site's name

# Local Variables
Meteor uses local environment variables for a few things, such as configuring email. While some platforms (like Modulus) make it easy to configure them from their web dashboard, on a local dev environment the best way is to set up an alias for the `mrt` command. 
For example, to configure Meteor to use Mailgun for email, in your `.bash_profile` file just add:
`alias m='MAIL_URL=smtp://username:password@smtp.mailgun.org:587/ mrt'`

This can also be useful for starting Meteor on a specific port:
`alias m4='MAIL_URL=smtp://username:password@smtp.mailgun.org:587/ mrt --port 4000'`
