# Telescope Nova

<<<<<<< HEAD
Version 0.27.5

This is the Apollo/GraphQL version of Telescope Nova. [You can find the documentation here](http://nova-docs.telescopeapp.org/).
=======
### Looking for the Apollo/GraphQL version? Check out the [devel](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/devel) branch. 

There are currently two distinct versions of Telescope: **Nova** and **Legacy**.

**Nova** is the new, React-based version and all development will happen on this version going forward. It's used by the [master](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/master) and [devel](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/devel) branches. 

Note that as of December 2016, the devel branch now uses [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) as its data layer while the master branch is still on the previous, non-GraphQL version. It is recommended you use the devel branch for any new projects if possible.
